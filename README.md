Abstract
----------


This paper establishes existence of recursive constrained social optima in a neoclassical growth model with idiosyncratic shocks, incomplete insurance markets and production, also known as the Aiyagari model. A constrained planner chooses individual saving and consumption through time, constrained by infinitely many agents' budget constraints, to maximise aggregate welfare. Due to the structure of the recursive problem and the Inada conditions interacting with an infinite dimensional state and action space, the feasibility correspondences for the constrained planner have non-compact image sets.   The requirements of standard dynamic optimisation theory, used show existence of optimal policies, are thus not satisfied. To address the challenge, first, the paper transforms the recursive problem to a sequential problem and shows existence of sequential optima implies existence of recursive optima. Second, the paper introduces a new existence result for non-compact dynamic optimisation problems and uses the theorem to verify existence of sequential optima.
